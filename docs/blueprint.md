# **App Name**: Overwatch Progression Tracker

## Core Features:

- Hero Dashboard: Displays a dashboard of Overwatch 2 heroes in a grid layout, showing the hero portrait and a dual progress bar for level and goal completion.
- Badge Input: Flyout overlay that appears when a hero portrait is clicked, allowing the user to input the number of Hero, Win, and Time Played sub-badges.
- Level Calculation: Calculates the hero's level and XP progress based on the number of sub-badges entered, using a non-linear progression system (60000XP per level after level 20).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use Overwatch 2's signature blue (#1E2E4A) for the background and primary UI elements.
- Secondary color: Use a lighter grey (#D3D3D3) for cards and interactive elements.
- Accent: Orange (#FF9F1C) for progress bars, highlights, and call-to-action buttons.
- Grid-based layout for the hero dashboard, ensuring a clean and organized presentation.
- Use Overwatch 2's hero icons or similar stylized icons.
- Subtle transitions and animations for flyout overlays and progress bar updates.
